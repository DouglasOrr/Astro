# Astro - simple simulator for having some fun with reinforcement learning

Aim - try to create a self-play-only reinforcement learning AI to play a simple little space simulation game, where you have to fly around, avoid planets & shoot the enemy.

## Getting started

Our dev entry point is the `run` script - e.g. to build a Docker image & get started:

    ./run build
    ./run test
    ./run server
